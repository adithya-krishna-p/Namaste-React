          Food delivery apps are third-party delivery services hosted on mobile
          applications that restaurants or retailers partner with to showcase
          their menu and food offerings, allowing customers to order food and
          get it delivered to their doorstep. Whether it's fast food or
          groceries, food delivery apps have revolutionized the restaurant and
          food delivery industry as they offer customers a convenient way to
          order food from the comfort of their homes.
